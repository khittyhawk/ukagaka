			<p>
				An ukagaka is a kind of desktop companion, a bit like an idle game, a bit like a VN. Some are largely utilitarian, but most have a personality and simulate a kind of buddy you can hang out with. Zarla has an explanatory YouTube video embedded below:

				Ukagaka run on a program called 'SSP', available <a href="http://sspnormal.shillest.net/">here</a>. The site is in Japanese and simple for non-Japanese speakers to click on the few necessary links.
				<br>
				Quonit has a video that explains how to download SSP. Mac users, however, need to go through a proxy program like WineBottler.

			<h3>Radio Nowhere</h3>
			<em>Is there anybody alive out there...?</em>
			<p>
				<br>
				Radio Nowhere mostly exists to sit and yell random phrases at you, like a radio from another dimension would. Or, if you want more of a storyline - These are broadcasts from another dimension, a collection of heresies, earworms, and memetic hazards, liberated from containment by subversives and loosed to the world on pirate radio.
				<br><br>
				In addition to its many dialogues (consisting of song lyrics, public domain fiction, riddles, and random thoughts), the radio has:
				<ul>
					<li>a customizable talk rate!</li>
					<li>multiple speaker decorations!</li>
					<li>local weather on the hour!</li>
					<li>the current date in the Hebrew and Jacobin calendars</li>
					<li>unit conversions</li>
					<li>a unit circle in degrees and radians</li>
					<li>a balloon tester for ukagaka devs</li>
					<li>a customizable to-do list!</li>
					
				</ul>
				and much more!
