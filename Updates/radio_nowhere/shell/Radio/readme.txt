This is Radio Nowhere!

It makes more sense for a radio to shout random snippets of dialogue at you than a boat, right?

The design of the sakura is roughly based on cathedral radios of the 1930s, but isn't based on any one specific model. The design of the kero is derived from art deco-style mid-century radios, but mostly after the Radio character from the Brave Little Toaster movies.

This should be the default shell for Radio Nowhere.
