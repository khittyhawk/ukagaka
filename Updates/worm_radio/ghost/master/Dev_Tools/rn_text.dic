	"\b[22]%(tmo)He walks.\w8\w8\w8\n\nHe walks in the hot,\w5\w5 dry,\w5\w5 windless desert.\w8\w8\w8\n\nSand,\w5\w5 rocks,\w5\w5 hills,\w5\w5 dunes,\w5\w5 the occasional scrawny cactus or dried bush.\w8\w8\w8\n\nNo sign of water.\w8\w8 Sometimes he'll see a little movement to one side or the other,\w5\w5 but whatever moved is usually gone before he can focus his eyes on it.\w8\w8\w8 Probably birds,\w3\w3 lizards,\w3\w3 or mice.\w8\w8\w8 Maybe snakes,\w5\w5 though they usually move more at night.\w8\w8 He's careful to stay away from the movements.\w8\w8\e"
	"\b[22]%(tmo)After a while,\w5\w5 he begins to stagger.\w8\w8 He's not sure if it's fatigue,\w5\w5 heat stroke finally catching him,\w5\w5 or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the wiper fluid was worse than he thought.\w8\w8 He tries to steady himself,\w5\w5 and keep going.\w8\w8\n\nAfter more walking,\w5\w5 he comes to a large stretch of sand.\w5\w5\w5\w5 This is good!\w5\w5 He knows he passed over a stretch of sand in the SUV \w3\w3- he remembers doing donuts in it.\w8\w8 Or at least he thinks he remembers it -\w3\w3 he's getting woozy enough and tired enough that he's not sure what he remembers any more or if he's hallucinating.\w8\w8 But he thinks he remembers it.\w8\w8\n\nSo he heads off into it,\w5\w5 trying to get to the other side,\w5\w5 hoping that it gets him closer to the town.\w8\w8\e"

	"\b[22]%(tmo)After a while,\w5\w5 he comes to a big dune in the sand.\w8\w8 This is bad.\w8\w8 He doesn't remember any dunes when driving over the sand in his SUV.\w8\w8 Or at least he doesn't think he remembers any.\w8\w8\n\nThis is bad.\w8\w8\n\nBut,\w3\w3 he has no other direction to go.\w8\w8 Too late to turn back now.\w8\w8 He figures that he'll get to the top of the dune and see if he can see anything from there that helps him find the town.\w8\w8 He keeps going up the dune.\w8\w8\e"
	"\b[22]%(tmo)Halfway up,\w5\w5 he slips in the bad footing of the sand for the second or third time,\w3\w3 and falls to his knees.\w8\w8 He doesn't feel like getting back up -\w2\w2 he'll just fall down again.\w8\w8 So,\w4\w4 he keeps going up the dune on his hands and knees.\w8\w8 While crawling,\w5\w5 if his throat weren't so dry,\w5\w5 he'd laugh.\w8\w8\n\nHe's finally gotten to the hackneyed image of a man lost in the desert -\w3\w3 crawling through the sand on his hands and knees.\w8\w8\e"
	"\b[22]%(tmo)If would be the perfect image,\w5\w5 he imagines,\w5\w5 if only his clothes were more ragged.\w8\w8 The people crawling through the desert in the cartoons always had ragged clothes.\w8\w8 But his have lasted without any rips so far.\w8\w8\n\nSomebody will probably find his dessicated corpse half buried in the sand years from now,\w5\w5 and his clothes will still be in fine shape -\w3\w3 shake the sand out,\w5\w5 and a good wash,\w5\w5 and they'd be wearable again.\w8\w8 He wishes his throat were wet enough to laugh.\w8\w8 He coughs a little instead,\w5\w5 and it hurts.\w8\w8\e"
	"\b[22]%(tmo)He finally makes it to the top of the sand dune.\w8\w8\w8\n\nNow that he's at the top,\w5\w5 he struggles a little,\w5\w5 but manages to stand up and look around.\w8\w8 All he sees is sand.\w8\w8 Sand,\w5\w5 and more sand.\w8\w8\n\nBehind him,\w5\w5 about a mile away,\w5\w5 he thinks he sees the rocky ground he left to head into this sand.\w8\w8 Ahead of him,\w5\w5 more dunes,\w5\w5 more sand.\w8\w8\n\nThis isn't where he drove his SUV.\w8\w8 This is Hell.\w8\w8 Or close enough.\w8\w8\e"
	"\b[22]%(tmo)Again,\w3\w3 he doesn't know what to do.\w8\w8 He decides to drink the rest of the wiper fluid while figuring it out.\w8\w8 He takes out the bottle,\w5\w5 and is removing the cap when he glances to the side and sees something.\w8\w8 Something in the sand.\w8\w8\n\nAt the bottom of the dune,\w2\w2 off to the side,\w5\w5 he sees something strange.\w8\w8 It's a flat area in the sand.\w8\w8 He stops taking the cap of the bottle off\w3\w3 and tries to look closer.\w8\w8 The area seems to be circular.\w8\w8 And it's dark -\w3\w3 darker than the sand.\w8\w8\n\nAnd,\w5\w5 there seems to be something in the middle of it,\w5\w5 but he can't tell what it is.\w8\w8 He looks as hard as he can,\w3\w3 and still\w4\w4 can't tell from here.\w8\w8 He's going to have to go down there and look.\w8\w8\e"
	"\b[22]%(tmo)He puts the bottle back in his pocket,\w5\w5 and starts to stumble down the dune.\w8\w8 After a few steps,\w5\w5 he realizes that he's in trouble -\w2\w2 he's not going to be able to keep his balance.\w8\w8 After a couple of more sliding,\w3\w3 tottering steps,\w5\w5 he falls and starts to roll down the dune.\w8\w8\e"
	"\b[22]%(tmo)The sand is so hot when his body hits it that for a minute he thinks he's caught fire on the way down -\w3\w3 like a movie car wreck flashing into flames as it goes over the cliff before it ever even hits the ground.\w8\w8 He closes his eyes and mouth,\w5\w5 covers his face with his hands,\w5\w5 and waits to stop rolling.\w8\w8\e"
	"\b[22]%(tmo)He stops at the bottom of the dune.\w8\w8\n\nAfter a minute or two,\w5\w5 he finds enough energy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes.\w8\w8 When he clears his eyes enough,\w5\w5 he looks around to make sure that the dark spot in the sand is still there and he hadn't just imagined it.\w8\w8\e"
	"\b[22]%(tmo)So,\w5\w5 seeing the large,\w4\w4 flat,\w4\w4 dark spot on the sand is still there,\w5\w5 he begins to crawl towards it.\w8\w8 He'd get up and walk towards it,\w5\w5 but he doesn't seem to have the energy to get up and walk right now.\w8\w8 He must be in the final stages of dehydration,\w3\w3 he figures,\w5\w5 as he crawls.\w8\w8\n\nIf this place in the sand doesn't have water,\w5\w5 he'll likely never make it anywhere else.\w8\w8 This is his last chance.\w8\w8\w8\e"
	"\b[22]%(tmo)He gets closer and closer,\w5\w5 but still can't see what's in the middle of the dark area.\w8\w8 His eyes won't quite focus any more for some reason.\w8\w8 And lifting his head up to look takes so much effort that he gives up trying.\w8\w8 He just keeps crawling.\w8\w8\n\nFinally,\w5\w5 he reaches the area he'd seen from the dune.\w8\w8\e"
	"\b[22]%(tmo)It takes him a minute of crawling on it before he realizes that he's no longer on sand \w3\w3- he's now crawling on some kind of dark stone.\w8\w8 Stone with some kind of marking on it -\w3\w3 a pattern cut into the stone.\w8\w8\n\nHe's too tired to stand up and try to see what the pattern is,\w3\w3 so he just keeps crawling.\w8\w8 He crawls towards the center,\w5\w5 where his blurry eyes still see something in the middle of the dark stone area.\w8\w8\e"
	"\b[22]%(tmo)His mind,\w5\w5 detached in a strange way,\w5\w5 notes that either his hands and knees are so burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain,\w5\w5 or that this dark stone,\w5\w5 in the middle of a burning desert with a pounding,\w5\w5 punishing sun overhead,\w5\w5 doesn't seem to be hot.\w8\w8 It almost feels cool.\w8\w8 He considers lying down on the nice cool surface.\w8\w8\e"
	"\b[22]%(tmo)Cool,\w5\w5 dark stone.\w8\w8 Not a good sign.\w8\w8 He must be hallucinating this.\w8\w8 He's probably in the middle of a patch of sand,\w5\w5 already lying face down and dying,\w3\w3 and just imagining this whole thing.\w8\w8 A desert mirage.\w8\w8 Soon the beautiful women carrying pitchers of water will come up and start giving him a drink.\w8\w8 Then he'll know he's gone.\w8\w8\n\nHe decides against laying down on the cool stone.\w8\w8 If he's going to die here in the middle of this hallucination,\w5\w5 he at least wants to see what's in the center before he goes.\w8\w8 He keeps crawling.\w8\w8\e"
	"\b[22]%(tmo)It's the third time that he hears the voice before he realizes what he's hearing.\w8\w8 He would swear that someone just said,\w5\w5\n\n1_qGreetings,\w5\w5 traveler.\w8\w8 You do not look well.\w8\w8 Do you hear me?o_q\w6\w6\n\nHe stops crawling.\w8\w8 He tries to look up from where he is on his hands and knees,\w5\w5 but it's too much effort to lift his head.\w8\w8\e"
	"\b[22]%(tmo)So he tries something different -\w3\w3 he leans back and tries to sit up on the stone.\w8\w8 After a few seconds,\w5\w5 he catches his balance,\w3\w3 avoids falling on his face,\w3\w3 sits up,\w3\w3 and tries to focus his eyes.\w8\w8 Blurry.\w8\w8 He rubs his eyes with the back of his hands and tries again.\w8\w8 Better this time.\w8\w8\e"
	"\b[22]%(tmo)Yep.\w8\w8 He can see.\w8\w8 He's sitting in the middle of a large,\w5\w5 flat,\w5\w5 dark expanse of stone.\w8\w8 Directly next to him,\w5\w5 about three feet away,\w5\w5 is a white post or pole about two inches in diameter and sticking up about four or five feet out of the stone at an angle.\w8\w8\n\nAnd wrapped around this white rod,\w3\w3 tail with rattle on it hovering and seeming ready to start rattling,\w3\w3 is what must be a fifteen foot long desert diamondback rattlesnake looking directly at him.\w8\w8\e"
	"\b[22]%(tmo)He stares at the snake in shock.\w8\w8 He doesn't have the energy to get up and run away.\w8\w8 He doesn't even have the energy to crawl away.\w8\w8 This is it,\w5\w5 his final resting place.\w8\w8 No matter what happens,\w5\w5 he's not going to be able to move from this spot.\w8\w8\e"
	"\b[22]%(tmo)Well,\w5\w5 at least dying of a bite from this monster should be quicker than dying of thirst.\w8\w8 He'll face his end like a man.\w8\w8 He struggles to sit up a little straighter.\w8\w8 The snake keeps watching him.\w8\w8 He lifts one hand and waves it in the snake's direction,\w5\w5 feebly.\w8\w8 The snake watches the hand for a moment,\w5\w5 then goes back to watching the man,\w5\w5 looking into his eyes.\w8\w8\n\nHmmm.\w8\w8 Maybe the snake had no interest in biting him?

	"\b[22]%(tmo)He then remembers that he'd looked up when he'd reached the center here because he thought he'd heard a voice.\w8\w8 He was still very woozy -\w3\w3 he was likely to pass out soon,\w5\w5 the sun still beat down on him even though he was now on cool stone.\w8\w8 He still didn't have anything to drink.\w8\w8\n\nBut maybe he had actually heard a voice.\w8\w8 This stone didn't look natural.\w8\w8 Nor did that white post sticking up out of the stone.\w8\w8 Someone had to have built this.\w8\w8 Maybe they were still nearby.\w8\w8 Maybe that was who talked to him.\w8\w8 Maybe this snake was even their pet,\w5\w5 and that's why it wasn't biting.\w8\w8\e"

	"\b[22]%(tmo)Jack nodded.\w8\w8 This was obviously very important to Nate,\w5\w5 so Jack didn't even joke about taking a talking rattlesnake out to see the world.\w8\w8 1_qYeah,\w5\w5 I can do that for you,\w5\w5 Nate.\w8\w8 Is that all you need?o_q\w5\w5 Jack could sense that was something more.\w8\w8\n\nNate looked at Sammy.\w8\w8 Sammy looked back at Nate for a second and then said,\w5\w5 1_qOh,\w5\w5 yeah.\w8\w8 Ummm,\w5\w5 I've gotta go pack.\w8\w8 Back in a little bit Jack.\w8\w8 Nice to meet ya!o_q\w6\w6 Sammy slithered back over the dune and out of sight.\w8\w8\n\nNate watched Sammy disappear and then looked back at Jack.\w8\w8 1_qJack,\w5\w5 this is my first son.\w8\w8 My first offspring through all the years.\w8\w8 You don't even want to know what it took for me to find a mate.o_q\w8\w8 Nate grinned to himself.\w8\w8 1_qBut anyway,\w5\w5 I had a son for a reason.\w8\w8 I'm tired.\w8\w8 I'm ready for it to be over.\w8\w8 I needed a replacement.o_q\w8\w8\e"

	"\b[22]%(tmo)Nate nodded.\w8\w8 1_qThanks,\w5\w5 Jack.\w8\w8 I only want two things.\w8\w8 One -\w4\w4 show Sammy around the world -\w4\w4 let him get his fill of it,\w5\w5 until he's ready to come back here and take over.\w8\w8 Two -\w4\w4 give me the fourth request.\w8\w8\n\n1_qI can't just decide to die,\w5\w5 not any more than you can.\w8\w8 I won't even die of old age like you eventually will,\w5\w5 even though it'll be a long time from now.\w8\w8 I need to be killed.\w8\w8 Once Sammy is back here,\w5\w5 ready to take over,\w5\w5 I'll be able to die.\w8\w8 And I need you to kill me.\w8\w8\n\n1_qI've even thought about how.\w8\w8 Poisons and other drugs won't work on me.\w8\w8 And I've seen pictures of snakes that were shot -\w4\w4 some of them live for days,\w5\w5 so that's out too.\w8\w8 So,\w5\w5 I want you to bring back a sword.o_q\w8\w8\e"
	"\b[22]%(tmo)Nate turned away to look back to the dune that Sammy had gone behind.\w8\w8 1_qI'd say an axe,\w5\w5 but that's somewhat undignified -\w4\w4 putting my head on the ground or a chopping block like that.\w8\w8 No,\w5\w5 I like a sword.\w8\w8 A time-honored way of going out.\w8\w8 A dignified way to die.\w8\w8 And,\w5\w5 most importantly,\w5\w5 it should work,\w5\w5 even on me.\w8\w8\n\n1_qYou willing to do that for me,\w5\w5 Jack?o_q Nate turned back to look at Jack.\w8\w8\e"
	"\b[22]%(tmo)1_qYeah,\w5\w5 Nate,o_q\w5\w5 replied Jack solemnly,\w5\w5 1_qI think I can handle that.o_q\w8\w8\n\nNate nodded.\w8\w8 1_qGood!o_q\w6\w6 He turned back toward the dune and shouted,\w5\w5 1_qSammy!\w5\w5 Jack's about ready to leave!o_q\w6\w6 Then quietly,\w5\w5 1_qThanks,\w5\w5 Jack.o_q\w8\w8\n\nJack didn't have anything to say to that,\w5\w5 so he waited for Sammy to make it back to the lever,\w5\w5 nodded to him,\w5\w5 nodded a final time to Nate,\w5\w5 and then headed into the desert with Sammy following.\w8\w8\e"
	"\b[22]%(tmo)Over the next several years,\w5\w5 Sammy and Jack kept in touch with Nate through e-mail as they went about their adventures.\w8\w8 They made a goal of visiting every country in the world,\w5\w5 and did a respectable job of it.\w8\w8\n\nSammy had a natural gift for languages,\w5\w5 as Jack expected he would,\w5\w5 and even ended up acting as a translator for Jack in a few of the countries.\w8\w8\n\nJack managed to keep the talking rattlesnake hidden even so,\w5\w5 and by the time they were nearing the end of their tour of countries,\w5\w5 Sammy had only been spotted a few times.\w8\w8\n\nWhile there were several people that had seen enough to startle them greatly,\w5\w5 nobody had enough evidence to prove anything,\w5\w5 and while a few wild rumors and storied followed Jack and Sammy around,\w5\w5 nothing ever hit the newspapers or the public in general.\w8\w8\e"
	"\b[22]%(tmo)When they finished the tour of countries,\w5\w5 Jack suggested that they try some undersea diving.\w8\w8\w8\w8 They did.\w8\w8 And spelunking.\w8\w8\w8\w8 They did that too.\w8\w8 Sammy finally drew the line at visiting Antarctica.\w8\w8 He'd come to realize that Jack was stalling.\w8\w8\n\nAfter talking to his Dad about it over e-mail,\w5\w5 he figured out that Jack probably didn't want to have to kill Nate.\w8\w8 Nate told Sammy that humans could be squeamish about killing friends and acquaintances.\w8\w8\e"
	"\b[22]%(tmo)So,\w5\w5 Sammy eventually put his tail down (as he didn't have a foot)\w3\w3 and told Jack that it was time -\w5\w5 he was ready to go back and take up his duties from his dad.\w8\w8 Jack delayed it a little more by insisting that they go back to Japan and buy an appropriate sword.\w8\w8 He even stretched it a little more by getting lessons in how to use the sword.\w8\w8\n\nBut eventually he'd learned as much as he was likely to without dedicating his life to it,\w5\w5 and was definitely competent enough to take the head off of a snake.\w8\w8 It was time to head back and see Nate.\w8\w8\e"
	"\b[22]%(tmo)When they got back to the US,\w5\w5 Jack got the old RV out of storage where he and Sammy had left it after their tour of the fifty states,\w5\w5 he loaded up Sammy and the sword,\w5\w5 and they headed for the desert.\w8\w8\n\nWhen they got to the small town that Jack had been trying to find those years ago when he'd met Nate,\w5\w5 Jack was in a funk.\w8\w8 He didn't really feel like walking all of the way out there.\w8\w8 Not only that,\w5\w5 but he'd forgotten to figure the travel time correctly.\w8\w8\e"
	"\b[22]%(tmo)It was late afternoon.\w8\w8 They'd either have to spend the night in town and walk out tomorrow,\w5\w5 or walk in the dark.\w8\w8\n\nAs Jack was afraid that if he waited one more night he might lose his resolve,\w5\w5 he decided that he'd go ahead and drive the RV out there.\w8\w8 It was only going to be this once,\w5\w5 and Jack would go back and cover the tracks afterward.\w8\w8 They ought to be able to make it out there by nightfall if they drove,\w5\w5 and then they could get it over that night.\w8\w8\e"
	"\b[22]%(tmo)Jack told Sammy to e-mail Nate that they were coming as he drove out of sight of the town on the road.\w8\w8 They then pulled off the road and headed out into the desert.\w8\w8\n\nEverything went well,\w5\w5 until they got to the sand dunes.\w8\w8 Jack had been nursing the RV along the whole time,\w5\w5 over the rocks,\w5\w5 through the creek beds,\w5\w5 revving the engine the few times they almost got stuck.\w8\w8\n\nWhen they came to the dunes,\w5\w5 Jack didn't really think about it,\w5\w5 he just downshifted and headed up the first one.\w8\w8 By the third dune,\w5\w5 Jack started to regret that he'd decided to try driving on the sand.\w8\w8 The RV was fishtailling and losing traction.\w8\w8 Jack was having to work it up each dune slowly and was trying to keep from losing control each time they came over the top and slid down the other side.\w8\w8 Sammy had come up to sit in the passenger seat,\w5\w5 coiled up and laughing at Jack's driving.\w8\w8\e"
	"\b[22]%(tmo)As they came over the top of the fourth dune,\w5\w5 the biggest one yet,\w5\w5 Jack saw that this was the final dune -\w5\w5 the stone,\w5\w5 the lever,\w5\w5 and somewhere Nate waited below.\w8\w8 Jack put on the brakes,\w5\w5 but he'd gone a little too far.\w8\w8 The RV started slipping down the other side.\w8\w8\n\nJack tried turning the wheel,\w5\w5 but he didn't have enough traction.\w8\w8 He pumped the brakes -\w5\w5 no response.\w8\w8 They started sliding down the hill,\w5\w5 faster and faster.\w8\w8\n\nJack felt a shock go through him as he suddenly realized that they were heading for the lever.\w8\w8 He looked down -\w5\w5 the RV was directly on course for it.\w8\w8 If Jack didn't do something,\w5\w5 the RV would hit it.\w8\w8 He was about to end humanity.\w8\w8\e"
	"\b[22]%(tmo)Jack steered more frantically,\w5\w5 trying to get traction.\w8\w8 It still wasn't working.\w8\w8 The dune was too steep,\w5\w5 and the sand too loose.\w8\w8 In a split second,\w5\w5 Jack realized that his only chance would be once he hit the stone around the lever - he should have traction on the stone for just a second before he hit the lever -\w5\w5 he wouldn't have time to stop,\w5\w5 but he should be able to steer away.\w8\w8\n\nJack took a better grip on the steering wheel and tried to turn the RV a little bit -\w5\w5 every little bit would help.\w8\w8 He'd have to time his turn just right.\w8\w8\e"
	"\b[22]%(tmo)The RV got to the bottom of the dune,\w5\w5 sliding at an amazing speed in the sand.\w8\w8 Just before they reached the stone Jack looked across it to check that they were still heading for the lever.\w8\w8 They were.\w8\w8 But Jack noticed something else that he hadn't seen from the top of the dune.\w8\w8\n\nNate wasn't wrapped around the lever.\w8\w8 He was off to the side of the lever,\w5\w5 but still on the stone,\w5\w5 waiting for them.\w8\w8 On the same side that Jack had picked to steer towards to avoid the lever.\w8\w8\n\nThe RV was already starting to drift that way a little in its mad rush across the sand and there was no way that Jack was going to be able to go around the lever to the other side.\w8\w8\e:eval=heardsnek=1"
