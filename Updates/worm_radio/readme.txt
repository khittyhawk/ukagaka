This is Radio Nowhere!

Enjoy snippets of heresy, earworms, in-jokes, and any other trash thoughts that have lodged themselves in your brain. These ideas were supposed to be in containment, but it looks like some whackadoo broadcast them all on pirate radio. Whoops!

Press 'r' while the ghost is highlighted to make it repeat what it just said. Press 't' for it to randomly say something.

Try clicking or mousing over different areas of the ghost(s)! Maybe you'll find something neat!

This ghost comes with a specialized balloon ('broadcast') and a specific font ('SQUARED2'). Don't be alarmed at the multiple downloads, please.

This ukagaka originated as a personal template, and it does still serve that function, somewhat. Paraphrasing Mrs. Basil E Frankweiler, it's a conglomeration of spaghetti that probably makes sense only to me. However! I am still proud of what I've accomplished and have been both aching to show it off and desiring to keep the reveal a secret, so I split the difference.

Mostly, I got sick of template text and started adding in other dialogues so I wouldn't go bonkers; then it occurred to me that it makes more sense for a radio to say random snippets than a ship. It does still have several features useful for devs. The Balloon Test will allow a dev to try out text of different fonts, colors, and sizes without having to constantly reload the ghost. I also tend to wing pause times, so I added in a feature that will allow you to try out the wait lengths in real-time.

If you were still hankering for a li'l boat to sail around your desktop, don't fret! I do have my in-progress "Ship of Theseus" shell available, though it does come with other... let's call them shenanigans. More information is in that shell's readme.
